# Missile Attack Alarm

Inspired by the false missile attack alarm issued in Hawaii on January 2018, this mock application now prioritises prevention of false alarms, but overkills. An awfully-designed user interface along with overzealous validations, converts a one-button-task into stomach ache. The legalese found almost in all websites today has also been sarcastically ridiculed by exaggerating the existing nonsensical norms.

## An exercise of Session Storage and Validations
This small app, which does nothing, has detailed technical documentation and a more advanced structure than that of Hawaii. And it is funny!
The documentation folder contains a requirements document and user acceptance testing of all test cases.
